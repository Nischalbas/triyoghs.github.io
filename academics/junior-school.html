                    The junior wing at Triyog High School comprises of approximately 200 students, aged from 9 to 10 years, who are supervised by an adequate number of committed teachers. A Coordinator is in charge of all the activities.Each Section in each Grade has two Co-Teachers working in tandem.Nepali, ICT, and ECAs are handled by a separate set of teachers.
                    </br></br>
                    Grades IV & V students are in a transitional phase. While progressive learning continues, students develop the knowledge & skills needed for their transition to higher classes and to inculcate the habit of studying independently. At this level, students are encouraged to explore and nurture their inherent talents. In addition, exposure to varied co-curricular and extracurricular activities help them to hone their interests and learning abilities.
                    </br></br>
                    Students actively participate in varied classroom activities, learning new skills and developing self-confidence. Furthermore, through participation in various intra- and inter-school competitions,students are encouraged to socialize extensively, develop team spirit, and strengthen their sense of community.
                    </br></br>
                    Focusing on the holistic development of the students, field trips, community activities, picnics, house presentations, and many other activities are incorporated in the school curriculum, which provide them with ample opportunities to observe, learn, and participate. Emphasis is laid on academic excellence supported by the assured development of life skills to assist our students become responsible citizens and good human beings. We regularly encourage students to participate in classroom activities and in the decision-making process so as to assist their overall growth.
                    </br></br>
                    Our practical approach to teaching, and participatory approach to conducting activities, has been fruitful in inculcating the right learning practices. Also, regular feedback and interactions with the students’ parents, or guardians, ensure the child’s continued overall development, as well as availability of full learning support, wherever and whenever needed.
